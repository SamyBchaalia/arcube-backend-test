## SALES METHODOLOGY & CORE FUNDAMENTALS
**Feature**: Describes physical attributes and functions of product/service
**Advantages**: Describes generic universal benefit of the feature
**Benefit**: An advantage becomes a benefit only if it satisfies a specific customer need

**Decision Analysis Process** - Critical questions:
- Who is the buyer?
- Who are the influencers and what are their roles?
- What is their relative influence?
- What are each of their issues/priorities/satisfiers?

**Sales Truisms** (Embraced):
- Selling is about understanding customer needs and fulfilling them
- Professional salespeople put customers first
- Not everyone is cut out to be a salesperson
- Salespeople are professionals who practice their craft continuously
- Success requires honesty, ethics, integrity, and treating everyone with dignity and respect

**Prerequisites for Successful Partnership**:
1. Shared Vision: Aligned goals and objectives
2. Short-Term "Win-Win": Immediate benefits and quick victories
3. Long-Term "Win-Win": Sustainable strategies for lasting success
4. Chemistry (Culture): Compatible working styles and values

## CUSTOMER ADOPTION & SEGMENTATION
**The 5 Customer Segments**:
1. Innovators: Technology enthusiasts, risk-takers, first to adopt
2. Early Adopters: Visionaries, opinion leaders, comfortable with change
3. Early Majority: Pragmatists, need proof before adopting
4. Late Majority: Skeptics, adopt when it becomes standard
5. Laggards: Traditionalists, last to adopt, resist change
